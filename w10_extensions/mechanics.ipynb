This is because our deformation has switched the polarization of the unit cell in the inner part of the system. In the middle of the transformation, there is a gap closing in the bulk, i.e. the zero mode extends through the bulk rather than being confined to either domain wall. You can explain this behavior using the analogy of polarization flux we have developed above."
