Since the field of topological insulators began,", "almost 10 years ago,", "relatively quickly we found experimental examples of the quantum spin-Hall effect in Cd/HgTe inversion layers, and strong topological", "insulators, the dominant materials are in the bismuth selenide (BiSe) and bismuth telluride (BiTe) class.", "The Chern insulator concept was introduced by Haldane almost 30 years ago and it wasn&#39;t", "until 2013 that experimentally the first realization of this was found.", "These materials have substantial band gaps. The BiSe class materials have a band gap of half eV.", "By making ultra-thin films of these and doping them", "with magnetic impurities, and giving them", "properly the Tsinghua in China was able to demonstrate Chern Insulator behavior in 2013 for the first", "time, but this strategy", "gives you a very narrow band gap and so the quantization, the approximated quantization of the Chern response", "was only seen below about one degree kelvin.", "So we&#39;d like to find a higher temperature, ideally a room temperature, examples of this", "class of materials.", "So, let&#39;s suppose we wanted to find a new kind of strong topological insulators, the BiSe", "class is good but it has some problems, for example the bulk conductivity is not as low", "as one would like, it turns to be leaky and therefore measurements of transport properties of surface", "states are complicated for example.", "So anyway we&#39;d like to find new materials realizations. What do we need to find something", "like this?", "First of all it has to be an insulator, and that means it has to have a band gap. We&#39;d like", "it to have a band gap of, let&#39;s say, greater than or equal to a quarter of an eV.", "That&#39;s about 10 times room temperature when you convert room temperature to energy by", "Boltzmann constant. So that would mean that the  number of thermally excited free carriers", "is E to the minus 10, that&#39;s a good rule of thumb for a robust insulator.", "So we&#39;d like to have a band gap of, let&#39;s say, a quarter of an eV or more, but it can&#39;t have a band gap that&#39;s too large.", "And the reason has to do with spin orbit interaction. A spin orbit interaction is critical for creating", "this state and the strength of the spin-orbit interaction is only up to one eV. And so if", "I had something that had a band gap of two eV, I can tell that it&#39;s not going", "to be a strong topological insulator.", "So let me explain this a little better. First with respect to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction.", "I have a periodic table here. We&#39;ll just look at it briefly. It&#39;s a little bit of a peculiar periodic table", "because it&#39;s ilustrated with desserts, so that for example Osmium is Oreos, and F is flan, and so on.", "But ignoring that, I just want to basically point to parts of the periodic table. The strength of the spin-orbit interaction for the light", "atoms is tiny. It&#39;s a few meV. It comes from relativistic motion of electrons in the core", "of the atom, which is more or less absent for light atoms. As you get down to, let&#39;s say,", "germanium, it&#39;s about a tenth of an eV, as you get down to, let&#39;s say, tellurium, it&#39;s maybe getting up", "to a half of an eV, and by the time you get to led and bismuth, it&#39;s approaching one eV.", "You need to have this spin-orbit interaction because we know that if the spin-orbit interaction", "were zero any insulator would be a normal insulator, it would not be a strong topological insulator.", "The way you can think about it is this. If I start the material from the state where the spin-orbit", "interaction is set to zero - so theoretically I can adjust the strength of", "spin orbit interaction for a given material like BiSe... if I crank up the strength of the spin-orbit interaction,", "then it starts out being a normal insulator, or possibly a normal metal, but let&#39;s say a normal insulator,", "at some point the band gap closes and opens again, and when it opens, it opens into the", "topological insulator phase. But the amount by which these bands can be manipulated is limited", "by the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. So, let&#39;s say, if the heaviest thing in the compound", "it&#39;s tellurrium, that&#39;s half an eV, that&#39;s really a maximum, so you&#39;re never going to be able to manipulate", "the bands by more than that.", "That&#39;s the reason why we&#39;re typically looking at materials that have gaps from a quarter of an eV,", "to a half to three quarters of an eV. That&#39;s we are likely to find.", "Another concept is a band inversion. So the way that this comes about, that you have strong topological insulator,", "is that at one point in the Brillouin zone, usually one of the high symmetry points,", "there are two states of different symmetry, with an arrangement without spin-orbit interaction,", "which gets reversed when you turn on spin-orbit interaction.", "So in BiSe class this happens at a gamma point... and it comes, it&#39;s built out of this quintuple layers,", "and you have states that have even or odd parity of with respect to the center of the slab,", "that cross when you turn on spin-orbit interactions.", "So that&#39;s another feature that we usually look for, in trying to arrive at topological", "insulator materials. It&#39;s not, well, it&#39;s not absolutely required, but almost all the materials", "we know about follow that scenario.", "OK, so if we&#39;re looking for strong topological insulators we want to look for materials that", "are coming from bottom of the periodic table. And so the chalcogenides involving antimony, tellurium, bismuth, led and so on are mostly", "the materials that people are looking at.", "Let me change gears and talk a little bit about  the search for higher-temperature Chern Insulators. ", "In this case again it has to be an insulator, so the same rule of thumb: if we want it to be working", "at room temperature we like the gap between a quarter and three quarters of an eV, ", "because it&#39;s going to be strong spin orbit that&#39;s responsible for arranging this.", "And it has to be time-reversal broken so it has to be a ferromagnet, it has to be a ferromagnetic insulator.", "Unfortunately there aren&#39;t all that many ferromagnetic insulators in room temperature in Nature,", "but there are enough, there are some, and so there is enough that we have a reasonable search space.", "Okay, so again why is time-reversal... I am sorry, why is spin-orbit interaction", "needed in this case. The basic idea is you are going to have a strong magnetic state, so the spin", "up and spin down bands are separated, let&#39;s say the spin up bands are topologically normal,", "their Chern number is zero, the spin down bands have a Chern number of one, then that", "system would be a Chern Insulator.", "In order for this spin down band to have a Chern number of one, it has to have broken time-reversal symmetry.", "Well, you can say that there&#39;s already broken time-reversal symmetry because of the spin separation, because of", "the exchange interaction of the spins. And in fact all materials, all the magnetic materials", "we know of, this is how the magnetism comes about. It comes about in a spin sector, you get", "this exchange splitting which separates the up and down spins in energy to some degree.", "But if there&#39;s no spin orbit interaction this time reversal breaking in the spin sector never", "gets communicated to the orbital sector, so if there&#39;s no time-reversal symmetry... if there is no spin-orbit coupling,", "then this manifold of electrons in one spin channel cannot have a non zero Chern number because", "it sees an effective Hamiltonian that&#39;s real. Only when you turn on the spin-orbit interaction,", "then it sees an effective Hamiltonian that&#39;s complex, like the one that&#39;s in the Haldane model.", "So that&#39;s why you need strong spin orbit in this case as well. There&#39;s a possible out,", "some people have discussed the possibility that electron-electron interactions could possibly", "break time-reversal symmetry directly in the orbital sector instead of the spin sector. If that were true, then there would not be", "time-reversal symmetry, but that&#39;s kind of a wild speculation at the moment, I think.", "Okay, so again, coming back to trying to realize this case.. since it&#39;s a 2D system we really do", "have a lot of design space here. You can have something which is, let&#39;s say, at the interface between", "two materials, let&#39;s say between a magnetic material and a material with strong spin-orbit,", "you can have something like graphene, some people have talked about decorating graphene", "with magnetic ions, and led and bismuth", "We&#39;ve done some work in our group, where we looked at the possibility of taking an insulating", "magnetic substrates and putting some monolayer, or fraction of a monolayer, of heavy atoms like led or bismuth on the surface.", "Other people have looked at taking 5d oxides. So, the 3d materials tends to be strongly", "magnetic, a 4d less, 5d somewhat less. But there are still magnetic 5d elements and", "the 5d elements also come with pretty strong spin-orbit interactions.", "So if you can arrange, let&#39;s say, for a plane of 5d magnetic ions to exist inside some material,", "this is another strategy that people have talked about.", "So I think it&#39;s interesting field, we&#39;re still in early days. So far the highest temperature", "Chern Insulator that we have is under one degree Kelvin, but I am sure that over the next", "five to ten years we&#39;ll find other examples, and greatly raise that limit. Whether we&#39;ll ever get to room temperature or not", "I don&#39;t know.. We don&#39;t have room temperature superconductors yet either, so maybe we have a long way", "to go.", "In any case, let me leave it here for the moment, and I will come back on the end of the segment."]}
