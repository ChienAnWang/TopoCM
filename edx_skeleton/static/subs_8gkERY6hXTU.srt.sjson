We all like topology, but why", "one should worry about imperfections, impurities, in that context, is perhaps not so obvious.", "In fact, when the modern era of topological insulators started, in 2005 or 6 or so, nobody", "really cared about disorder.", "The mantra at that time was that topology is actually iltra-universal, it does not care", "about system specific imperfections, and certainly not about a bit of dirt in the system.", "That argument is factually correct but also a bit academic. As you will see in the next", "week, it certainly misses upon universal and actually quite beautiful physics.", "In fact, it doesn&#39;t take too much imagination to anticipate that the impact of disorder", "on a topological insulator will be profound.", "Let me briefly list some of the more striking issues in that context.", "First: we are all used to hear that topology in a band insulator is robust unless you close", "the bulk gap. However, disorder is actually quite efficient at closing gaps.", "Even a weak amount of impurities will lead to an emergency of mid-gap states and hence", "to a globally non-vanishing single-particle density of states on average.", "So, if we suspect topology to survive that intrusion, then we need to come up with ways", "to describe it without making reference to the presence of band gaps.", "Second: disorder can compromise the integrity of topological indices. If you put a given", "system for a given realization of disorder in a computer, and compute its index, then", "you will get an integer. But that integer may depend on the actual realization of impurities", "in your system, and if you are working close to a topological phase transition point, that", "sensitivity can become profound.", "Which is to say that the topological index effectively becomes a random variable with,", "in general, non-integer mean.", "And that disorder-averaged index variable will in fact turn out to be one of the main", "players in the game, as you will see in the next week.", "Third, there is also maybe a little more methodological point to consider. 99 percent of our theory", "of topological insulators is based on momentum space classification. So we all love to compute", "indices as invariants defined in some microscopically defined Brillouin zone.", "However, the first thing to fall victim to disorder is translational invariance and hence", "to concept of a microscopic Brillouin zone.", "So if you want to generalize our understanding of topological matter to non-translational", "invariant settings, then we need to understand how to classify topological matter in real", "rather than in momentum space.", "Now the question to be addressed in the next week is how to deal with all these points.", "And fortunately it turns out that we don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel here.
