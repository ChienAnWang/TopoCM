There are two reasons for that.", "If I first consider this 4\u03c0 periodic Josephson effect, you would say, OK, easy enough!", "I start somewhere, let&#39;s start here, supposedly in the 4\u03c0 periodic effect.", "I start here, I wind the phase, incrementing the flux, I wind the phase incrementing it", "by 2\u03c0, and then I see whether I am back to where I have started or not.", "And the problem is... there are two problems.

I know of just one such topic, one such subfield,", "and that&#39;s the quantum Hall effect.
