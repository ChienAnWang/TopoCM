This bulk invariant determines the number of chiral modes on the edge. For", "the quantum spin Hall effect, the up and down spins have opposite Chern numbers, so the", "total Chern number is zero. When spin is not conserved, the individual Chern numbers lose", "their meaning. Nonetheless, time reversal protects the helical edge modes, so there", "must still be a topological difference when time reversal is present. In fact, with time", "reversal there are only two distinct topological classes, and they are distinguished by a Z2 invariant.", "The mathematical formulation of the Z2 invariant is a bit involved. What I would like to show", "you here is that is very easy to understand why there are two and only two topological", "classes. This can be done by thinking about the possible structures of the edge states.", "Here I show two hypothetical band structures for the edge of a two dimensional insulator", "as a function of the momentum along the edge. I have plotted only half of the Brillouin", "zone from k=0 to pi, since the other half is simply a mirror image due to time reversal", "symmetry.", "It is always possible that there can be states within the energy gap that are localized at", "the edge. However, if they are present, then Kramers theorem guarantees that they must", "be twofold degenerate at k=0. If there is no spin orbit interaction then every state", "is two fold degenerate, so nothing is new. However, if there is a spin orbit interaction,", "then in general the states will split away from k=0. In that case, the Kramers partner", "for k is at -k. However, when you get to momentum \\pi, +pi and -pi correspond to the same crystal", "momentum. It follows that the states at k=\\pi must be Kramers degenerate as well.", "Now you can see why there are two and only two classes: There are two ways the Kramers", "pairs at k=0 can connect with the Kramers pairs at Pi. If they connect pairwise, then", "it is possible to get rid of the edge states completely by pushing them up or down, outside of the energy gap.", "So you might have edge states but you don&#39;t necessarily do.", "However, if the Kramers pairs &quot;switch partners&quot;, then you can push them up or down all you want.", "As long as time reversal symmetry is unbroken they are impossible to get rid of. There will", "always be an odd number of bands crossing the Fermi energy between 0 and pi.", "How does a two dimensional insulator decide which scenario occurs at the edge?", "Well, it&#39;s the bulk Z2 invariant, which characterizes the band structure.

But flux h/2e is time reversal invariant,", "because -h/2e differs from +h/2e by h/e, which can be gauged away.", "Threading half a flux quantum transfers half a spin up electron from the inside to the", "outside and half a spin down electron from the outside to the inside. Thus no net charge", "is transferred, but the net effect is to transfer a single electrons worth of spin from the", "inside to the outside. The local spin on the inside thus changes from being integer to", "half integer (or vise versa).", "This change in the spin has an important consequence due to time reversal symmetry: Half integer", "spins have a Kramers degeneracy, while integer spins do not. Thus the ground state at the", "edge switches between being Kramers degenerate and not Kramers degenerate. This is closely", "related to the pattern of edge states as a function of momentum. Indeed, if one views", "the entire annulus as one unit cell, then the magnetic flux plays the role of the momentum.", "And you can understand this Kramers parity switching that occurs when you thread half of a flux quantum.", "Whether the Kramers parity changes when flux h/2e is inserted is a yes-no question that", "can not change as long as the bulk gap remains finite. It is a topolgocial criterion that", "remains valid when spin is no longer conserved, and also when the electrons interact.", " It shows that topological and trivial insulators are distinct even with interactions. It guarantees", "that the edge of a topological insulator can not have a unique ground state separated by", "a gap from excited states, since otherwise it would be impossible to have a Kramers degeneracy", "when the flux is \u03c0.", "However, it does not guarantee that the edge is gapless.

This is a fascinating subject which has many different aspects and has seen", "a great deal of progress in the last few years.
