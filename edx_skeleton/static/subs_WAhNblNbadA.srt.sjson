What I would like to do in the next couple", "of", "minutes is explain to you that these are not two separate effects, but are, you could say,", "two sides of the same coin. It&#39;s one characteristic of topological superconductors,", "which you can observe in two different ways. And to do that I would like to consider a", "superconducting ring, enclosing a flux Phi. There is a magnetic field, the ring encloses", "a flux, and there is a little barrier here. This is what we call a Josephson junction.", "Typically when we have a Josephson junction, instead of working with the flux through the", "ring, we like to speak of the phase difference across the junction.", "They&#39;re just directly related, so that a phase increment of 2\u03c0 corresponds to a flux  increment", "of h/2e. You will recall that the flux quantum in superconductivity", "is Planck&#39;s constant divided by the charge of the Cooper pair, 2e.", "So we can either say that there is a flux or that there is a phase difference, it&#39;s", "the same thing. And then we can ask what is the excitation", "spectrum of this Josephson junction, and this has a structure which we have encountered before.", "So, there&#39;s an energy axis and there is a phase (or a flux) axis.", "The spectrum has this particle-hole (plus or minus E) symmetry, so every level up here", "is mirrored by a level down here. It winds around and there can be level crossings", "at E=0, that&#39;s the Fermi level, and in a Josephson junction with broken time-reversal symmetry", "these crossings can exist. In this case there&#39;s two crossings, an even", "number of them. This is you could say the generic thing, the thing you would expect,", "because if I follow one level by winding the phase slowly, incrementing the flux very slowly,", "I will follow this line and after a phase increment of 2\u03c0 I am back where I started.", "So in this particular case here all the properties of the junction are periodic in the phase", "in units of 2\u03c0, or alternatively you could say they are periodic in the flux in units", "of h/2e, and that&#39;s how superconductors should behave.", "But now there is another mathematical possibility, whether it&#39;s realized in Nature that&#39;s the", "next thing to think about, but certainly it is possible that the spectrum looks like this.", "So what&#39;s the difference? Well it looks difference, but the topological", "difference is that this has an odd number of level crossings, just one.", "This has two level crossings, while here there&#39;s just one level crossing.", "So now if I follow this level slowly, adiabatically, and I wind the phase by 2\u03c0, I am not back.", "I have to wind another 2\u03c0 and so the properties of this Josephson junction are periodic in", "phase in units of 4\u03c0 or, in the flux, the corresponding periodicity would be h/e.", "That&#39;s very strange because this is superconductivity, and single charge should not appear, everything", "should be in units of the Cooper pair charge, 2e.", "So this is an anomaly, and this anomaly is called a topological, or topologically non-trivial, superconductor.", "And this effect here, that the periodicity of the Josephson effect is 4\u03c0, instead of", "2\u03c0, that&#39;s what we call the 4\u03c0-periodic Josephson effect.", "That&#39;s the first key signature of topological superconductivity.", "Now we turn to the second signature, which is the appearance of these zero modes, these", "Majorana resonances at zero energy.

It cannot do that!", "Because it does not have a partner. If there were three crossings, two of them", "could go away, but one would always remain. There&#39;s an odd number of them.", "So this crossing cannot go away, it has to stay there, it can also not be flux dependent,", "it has to be flat.

It&#39;s actually two levels, so where are these", "levels? Well that&#39;s not rocket science of course,", "one will be on this side of the barrier, the other will be on the other side of the barrier.", "The don&#39;t repel because there&#39;s this big barrier, so they don&#39;t see each other, and if you imagine", "straightening this out. then you have your wire with one zero level here and one zero", "level here. That&#39;s this thing which is called a zero mode,", "it&#39;s called a Majorana zero mode, and that&#39;s basically much of what you will be hearing", "about this time and also in the other lectures.
