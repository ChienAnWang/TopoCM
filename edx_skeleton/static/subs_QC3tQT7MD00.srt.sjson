I am here to introduce you to the", "quantum Hall effect, one of the most beautiful physical phenomenon I am aware of.", "Let us start with the classical Hall effect. You know the story \u2013 electrical current", "flows in the x-direction. A magnetic field is applied in the z-direction perpendicular", "to the plane. It applies a Lorenz force directed in the y-direction. A voltage then develops", "in the y-direction to counteract the Lorenz force, and that is the Hall voltage. Since", "it is there to cancel the Lorenz force, which is proportional to the magnetic field, we", "expect the Hall voltage to be linear in the magnetic field. So will, we expect, be the", "Hall resistivity, the ratio of the Hall voltage to the current.", "Well, at low temperatures, two dimensional clean systems, the Hall voltage starts linear", "in magnetic field, but then it develops steps. Look at this plot, you change the magnetic", "field by tens of percents, and the Hall voltage seems not to change at all, it\u2019s on a plateau,", "it looks like a straight line. In fact, when we say it does not change, we mean IT DOES", "NOT CHANGE. When we say a straight line, we mean it is the straightest line you have ever", "seen. It is precise to a level of one part in a billion, give or take. Not only that,", "the Hall resistivity is quantized to that level of precision in units of h/e^2, the", "ratio of Plank&#39;s constant to the electric charge squared. Think about it, it is independent", "of details such as the material used, the shape of the sample, the name of the experimentalist", "or the day of the week. This is what we call a topological number, a topological phenomenon.", "Now look at how the sample looks \u2013 this is the original sample where the fractional", "quantum Hall effect was discovered, you\u2019ll hear about the fractional effect later. Would", "you imagine that from such a dirty looking sample the ratio of two of the fundamental", "constants of the universe would emerge? I have to say, before going into details,", "this is so beautiful. And as we will now see, this data tells us, loud and clear, a few", "points that we should note. Let us go over them. First, together with the quantization", "of the Hall resistivity, as we see, the longitudinal resistivity looks as vanishing. What this", "says is that the current and electric field are perpendicular to one another. Curiously,", "this implies that the longitudinal conductivity vanishes as well, while the Hall conductivity", "is quantized this time in units of e^2/h. If the Hall conductivity is an integer number", "of e^2/h&#39;s, we call the effect \u201cthe Integer Quantum Hall Effect\u201d. If it is a fraction,", "you guess, we call it the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.", "In fact, the temperature dependence of both the longitudinal conductivity and the longitudinal", "resistivity is activated, going like exponent of minus T_zero over T, indicating that the", "state is gapped, i.e., that there is an energy gap between the ground state and the first", "excited state. We are familiar with gapped systems, most notably the Bloch insulator,", "where the conductivity is activated. Gapped systems generally show activated behavior", "of various response functions. But here there is a twist \u2013 the gap must close at the edges", "of the sample. To see that, let us look at an annular geometry. This geometry will teach", "us quite a bit. Let us imagine that the bulk of the annulus is in a quantum Hall state,", "and now we turn on a magnetic flux inside the hole at the center of the annulus. We", "turn on the magnetic flux, we get an azimuthal electric field, which leads to a radial current,", "and to a polarization of charge between the interior edge and the exterior edge. Now,", "if the bulk has a longitudinal conductivity, this charge could have relaxed, like in a", "metal. In the absence of such conductivity, like in a quantum Hall state, the charge accumulates", "at the edges. But then there must be unoccupied states for the accumulating charge to occupy.", "And since the perturbation we apply to the system, the electric field, that is, is of", "low frequency(we do it very slowly), and it is of the order of one over the system size,", "the energy of these states must be close to the chemical potential. So, the gap must close", "at the edge. Let\u2019s reiterate and generalize that, it is an important point. At the interface", "between two regions of different Hall conductivities (one here, one here) there must be a closure", "of the gap in between. The annular system that we are looking at", "may then be viewed as made of three pieces, The exterior edge, that is one dimensional", "and gapless, the bulk, that is two dimensional, gapped and somewhat \u201cdead\u201d. And the interior", "edge, that is one dimensional and gapless again. But note, you should be careful when", "thinking about the edges as one dimensional system in the way you think, for example,", "of a quantum wire. For example, note that the charge on the edge is not conserved: as", "we say, the radial current that we push when we change the flux changes the charge on the", "two edges. Another way of saying that is \u2013 if you try to peel-off the edge of the sample,", "you will end up with a thinner annulus that still has gapless states at its edges.", "Now let us add another ingredient, a purely quantum mechanical one. The spectrum of the", "annulus must be periodic with respect to the flux at the central hole, with a period of", "one flux quantum, h over e. This is the Aharonov-Bohm effect. So, if we set the annulus to be in", "its ground state with zero flux at the hole, and we change the flux adiabatically to one", "flux quantum, we will end up with the system still being in an eigenstate. It will not", "be the ground state anymore, since charge has flown from one edge to another, but it", "will be an eigenstate. This is completely general, it relies only on the system being", "in a quantum Hall state. Next let us limit ourselves to non-interacting", "electrons, and leave interactions to far later in the course. For non-interacting electrons", "the eigenstates may be described in terms of single particle states, which are either", "occupied or vacant. At the ground state all single particle states below the chemical", "potential are filled and all those above the chemical potential are vacant. At excited", "states, some empty states get filled and some occupied ones become vacant. As we saw, as", "we turn flux on, charge moves between the edges, say from the interior to the exterior,", "until \u2013 when we get to one flux quantum \u2013 the system ends up in an eigenstate of", "the system. Since the only eigenstates available at low energy are at the edge, turning on", "one flux quantum must result in a transfer of an integer number of electrons between", "the edges. And this statement is precisely the statement that the Hall conductivity is", "quantized to an integer number of e^2 over h. It also makes a connection between the", "quantum Hall effect (for now the integer quantum Hall effect) and the notion of a pump that", "was discussed in earlier classes. The thought experiment we discussed is a pump that makes", "electrons go from one edge to another."]}
