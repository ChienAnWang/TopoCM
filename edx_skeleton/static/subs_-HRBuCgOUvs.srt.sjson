So let&#39;s first recapitulate ", "the BHZ model. In the BHZ model you have four ", "ingredients, them being you have a band of", "electrons with the positive mass, you have a band of holes", "with a negative mass, in order to be in a topological regime", "you have to be... have the band order inverted. That is,", "the band of the holes has to be above of the band", "bottom of the electrons. And as a fourth ingredient you have to have", "a coupling between electrons and holes that is linear in momentum.", "Ok? So these are the four ingredients. Depending on the strength of this", "coupling", "this coupling, this coupling then gives you a band structure as shown in black here,", "which can either have the minimum at k=0", "or two minima at finite momentum.", "So you&#39;ve seen something similar already in the Kitaev model and in the p-wave", "superconductor.", "So we see that these types of band structures come up very often in this", "course.", "Now, we have now these four ingredients for the BHZ model,", "it turns out that Nature actually gives us a very common material with  three", "ingredients", "for free - namely normal semiconductors. Those have", "electrons, those have holes and they have a k-linear coupling between them,", "because the electrons they come from s-like orbitals and the holes come from p-like orbitals.", "Now what&#39;s missing usually in semiconductors", "is the band inversion. Because usually you have the", "electrons on top, then you have a band gap and then you have the holes", "for low energies, so that&#39;s a trivial band structure.", "But it turns out that there&#39;s one semiconductor in Nature,", "namely mercury telluride (HgTe), that&#39;s an alloy of mercury", "and tellurium, that has this band inversion", "quite naturally. So this in principle is a natural candidate material for a", "topological insulator. Now, it turns out that there are some complications", "because this mercury telluride has some other bands which spoil the gap,", "so one way to get rid of these additional bands is instead of having", "just mercury telluride,", "we actually make a stack, a heterostructure", "out of cadmium telluride (CdTe), mercury telluride", "and cadmium telluride again. And with this confinement you get rid of all unwanted", "bands, and you&#39;re just left with the electrons and the holes which form ", "the topological band structure. Now, is this the only ", "material in semiconductors that we can have? Well, it would seem so because that&#39;s the", "only one that has this band order naturally,", "but you know there&#39;s nothing that tells us that these electrons and holes have to be", "in the same material.", "And there&#39;s another candidate material for a topological insulator ", "that we can build as follows. We can take", "a layer of indium arsenide (InAs) and a layer of gallium antimonide (GaSb),", "and the band offsets of these materials are just such that", "the electron in indium arsenide are below  the holes in the gallium antimonide.", "So that also gives us an inverted band structure.", "Now in this case the tunneling between these two layers", " is giving us this k-linear coupling because it goes between layers,", "it&#39;s usually", "less strong than in mercury telluride, and the band structure will usually  look like", "this here,", "as I draw it here. Now this is the original", "material that Bernevig, Hughes and Zhang were predicting", "to be a topological insulator, and that subsequently was", "observed experimentally at Wurzburg. This material is newer,", "it was also predicted by the group of Zhang, and there&#39;s now ", "many labs in the world that are trying to make this material a topological insulator.", "So now we know about materials for", "two dimensional topological insulators.", "Now suppose you have such a material we also have to measure it, you have to show that", "it&#39;s a two dimensional topological insulator,", "So what would be the possibilities.", "You already know that two dimensional topological insulators", "have edge states which have a special property that these edge states cannot  scatter into each other.", "They&#39;re protected by time-reversal symmetry. And we can now probe these edge states", "by passing a current through them. So if you apply a voltage here to these ", "two sides of the sample, then a current will flow through these  edge states,", "and this will give rise to a characteristic  value of the", "resistance. However you do not need to restrict yourself to such a", "two terminal set up. You can also go more crazy. Now, you&#39;ve already seen", "in the quantum Hall effect that you can measure so-called non-local resistances", "in a multi-terminal setup. In the quantum Hall effect this was the Hall resistance.", "Now in this case there&#39;s no Hall resistance because you have time-reversal symmetry,", "but still you can measure non-local  resistance by for example passing a current", "through these terminals here and  measuring the voltage here.", "And since you have these reflectionless edge channels connecting all these different leads,", "you will measure characteristic, universal values", "of the non-local resistance.", "A second way to probe the edge channels in a two-dimensional topological", "insulator is to try to destroy this  topological insulator phase,", "to try to make these edge channels reflect. Now spin-orbit", "for example, that we already know that doesn&#39;t do the trick.", "Because the spin-orbit does not break time-reversal symmetry", "and since these are protected by time-reversal symmetry", "there&#39;s no back scattering. So what we really need to do is we need to break", "time-reversal symmetry. The easiest way to do that", "is with a magnetic field. And in fact you can already think that something has to", "happen in a magnetic field, because", "consider the case of a very strong magnetic field. Eventually we have to go", "into the quantum Hall regime,", "and in the quantum Hall regime you only have edge channels going", "in one direction, so you have to kill one of these edge states.", "This is something that will happen in the  magnetic field.", "Now I sketched to you", "two ways to probe the topological  regime.", "Now let&#39;s take a more detailed look."]}
