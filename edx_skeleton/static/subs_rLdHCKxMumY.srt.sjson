So", "what&#39;s topological order? Well, first we should imagine what kind of systems we&#39;re talking", "about. We&#39;re talking about systems at low temperature, zero temperature, quantum many-body", "systems of interacting particles such as a quantum Hall system, or a system of interacting", "spins. Now there&#39;s no rigorous definition of topological order in the literature. Usually", "topological order is contrasted with the idea of local order, or existence of a local order", "parameter which characterizes a phase. A good example of that is magnetization of a phase.", "So other features of topological order which are related to this, which are characteristic,", "are the following: so our quantum many-body system will have a ground state, will have", "a state of lowest energy, and this state may be degenerate or non-degenerate. And for a", "topologically ordered system this degeneracy depends on topology. So if we have a two-dimensional", "system, and we put this system on a sphere, then the ground state will be non-degenerate,", "unique. Whereas if we put it on a torus, or we put it on a torus with many handles, this", "ground state will be non-unique, and it will depend on how many handles the torus has.", "Now let&#39;s imagine that we put our two-dimensional system on a torus, and the ground state space", "is therefore non-degenerate, and we ask whether it&#39;s possible to do a local measurement on", "a few degrees of freedom so that we can tell which of the ground states we have. So we", "do a local observation, and we ask &#39;can we tell whether the system is in this ground", "state or in another ground state&#39;. The answer for topologically ordered systems is &#39;no&#39;,", "and this goes hand in hand with the non-existence of a local order parameter. The third feature", "of topological order lies in the nature of excitations. So for two-dimensional topological", "ordered systems these excitations are Abelian anyons or non-Abelian anyons, and you&#39;ll see", "some of that demonstrated in the toric code model in your course. These interesting features", "of topological order lead Alexey Kitaev in 1997 to formulate the toric code model that", "you&#39;ll learn about. The toric code really shows in the simplest forms the ideas behind", "the topological order for the two-dimensional systems. In this sense, I would say, the toric", "code is our modern day Ising model, and it&#39;s also a very good example of a quantum error", "correction code. The toric code nowadays also lies at the basis of the very attractive scheme", "for doing quantum computation. This comes about as follows: you&#39;ll learn about the toric", "code, as a 2D lattice of spin one half particles, or qubits, which together interact via Hamiltonian", "so that this Hamiltonian has a ground state degeneracy on a torus. In this degenerate", "ground state space (the ground space degeneracy is four-dimensional), in this degenerate ground", "space one can therefore encode new qubits, and these qubits will be better protected", "that the elementary constituent qubits, from which this lattice is built. So the idea is", "that once we build pretty good qubits with using superconducting qubits, or qubits based", "on Majorana fermions, we can put these together in arrays, and let them interact together,", "such that we obtain a many-body system, which has a ground space degeneracy, which defines", "a space, in which we can put even better protected qubits. I hope you&#39;ll enjoy learning about", "topological order and the toric code in the course."]}
