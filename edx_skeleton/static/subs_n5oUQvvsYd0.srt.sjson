At that", "time, there were two ideas in the air. The first was graphene, and the exciting possibility", "that it could be studied experimentally. The second was the idea that the spin orbit interaction", "could lead to an intrinsic spin Hall effect. It occurred to me that these two ideas could", "be combined, which led Gene Mele and I to develop a theory for the quantum spin Hall", "effect.", "The idea is quite simple, now that you have an understanding of the integer quantum Hall", "effect. The integer quantum Hall effect requires a magnetic field, which violates time reversal", "symmetry. However, if we take *two copies* of the integer quantum Hall state, one for", "the up spins and one for the down spins, then time reversal symmetry can be restored.", "Time reversal symmetry does two things in quantum mechanics: it takes the complex conjugate", "of the wavefunction and it flips the spin. Therefore a Hamiltonian in which the up and", "down spins are in opposite quantum Hall states is invariant under time reversal.", "If you apply an electric field in this state, then the up spins go up, while the down spins", "go down. There is no net Hall current, but there is a net flow of spin. When spin is", "conserved, this spin current defines a quantized spin Hall conductivity. We therefore called", "this the quantum spin Hall effect.", "We started by considering a tight binding model of graphene with a symmetry allowed", "spin orbit interaction, that leads to a spin dependent second neighbor hopping term. This", "model turned out to be precisely two copies of the model Duncan Haldane showed you last", "week. It describes a time reversal invariant insulator, but since it is two copies of the", "quantum Hall effect, it must have edge states on the boundary. The edge states for up and", "down spins propagate in opposite directions. We call these helical edge states.", "Though we knew the edge states had to be there, it was a simple enough matter use the tight", "binding model to compute the eigenstates in a strip geometry to see them explicitly. The", "result of that calculation looked like this. You can see that there is a bulk energy gap, separating the conduction band and the valence band. But inside the", "gap are bands localized at the edge. The up spins have a positive group velocity, while", "the down spins have a negative group velocity. Since there are counterpropagating modes,", "the edge states are not chiral. They form a kind of one dimensional conductor at the", "edge.", "Now, my first thought about this was that this was kind of artificial, since it was predicated on having", "independent Hamiltonians for the up and down spins, which is certainly not what you have", "in reality. The up and down spin bands cross, and everyone knows that when you have degeneracies, ", "degenracies will be lifted by arbitrarily weak perturbations. So I set out to add perturbations that violated the", "conservation of S_z and get rid of the edge states. But no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#39;t", "get rid of them! This was a puzzle until I realized that the band crossing was protected", "by time reversal symmetry.", "Time reversal symmetry has a deceptively simple consequence for states with half integer spin,", "and this is called Kramers&#39; theorem: every eigenstate of a time reversal invariant Hamiltonian is", "at least twofold degenerate. The two eigenstates that are crossing - at this crossing here - ", "form a Kramers pair,", "and that degeneracy can not be lifted by any time reversal invariant perturbation", " - even if the conservation of spin is violated.", "So time reveral symmetry guarantees you have a one dimensional conductor at the edge. But", "what about disorder?  Disordered electronic systems are known to be susceptible to Anderson localization.", "In one dimension, eigenstates are localized by arbitrarily weak disorder. ", "So the expectation was that if you made this edge a little bit dirty, then it should become localized.", "The reson for this is that elastic backscattering due to disorder is a relevant perturbation.", "But in the problem at hand, backsattering on the edge requires a spin flip: sort of like S^-. But this is odd under", "time reversal. The upshot is that the lowest order elastic backscattering process is forbidden", "by time reversal symmetry. So for weak disorder maybe it&#39;s possible to evade Anderson localization.", "But what about strong disorder? What if the edges are really dirt?", "Getting ready for sleep one night I posed myself the following thought experiment. Suppose", "you have a helical edge with an arbitrarily long disordered region, but is clean", "on the sides. What happens if you have an electron that&#39;s incident from the left? This is a classic", "transmission problem, so there are only two possibilities: either it is transmitted all the way acoss,", "or it is reflected. Those are the two only places the electron could go.", "And so the question I asked myself was what is the constraint that time reversal", "symmetry imposes on the reflection amplitude. That&#39;s a question that kept me up for a while, but", "I was able to convince myself that the reflection amplitude must be *odd* under time reversal.", "And so what this means is that if you have time reversal symmetry,", "the reflection amplitude has to be equal to zero, which means that the transmission", "is perfect! Now, this got me quite excited. ", "And fortunately, it was still true when I woke up the next morning.", "This means that the eigenstates of a helical edge can not be localized - even for strong", "disorder. The helical edge is immune from Anderson localization.", "This is sort of... a similar situation happens at the edge of the integer quantum Hall effect, ", "with the chiral edge states.", "So, this poses  an interesting question:", " what is it about the insulator that guarantees that it has", "the helical edge states? So this is the question that I&#39;ll return to at the end."]}
