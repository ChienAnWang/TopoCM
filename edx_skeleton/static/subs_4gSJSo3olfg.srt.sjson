What was discovered by Tsui, Stormer,", "and Gossard at Bell laboratories in 1982 was when you go to a very high magnetic field,", "a two-dimensional electron gas happens to be in semiconductors, that&#39;s where they exist,", "shows a fractional Hall conductance in units of e^2/h. Now what do I mean by &#39;fractional", "quantization&#39;? Well let&#39;s take a step back and talk about integer quantum Hall effect", "a little bit. In 1980 Klaus von Klitzing discovered that a two-dimensional electron gas subjected", "to a very strong magnetic field shows integer quantization, which basically means that the", "Hall conductance is quantized in units of e^2/h when you have an integer number of Landau", "levels occupied. When you apply a strong magnetic field to a two-dimensional electron gas, the", "density of states decomposes into a bunch of Landau levels. So as you move the chemical", "potential, or as you increase magnetic field, that means that you change electron density,", "or you change magnetic field your Fermi level is moving through Landau levels. So you can", "have a certain number of Landau levels occupied. And what Klaus von Klitzing found that the", "Hall conductance is quantized, and the quantization number corresponds to the number of integral", "filling of Landau levels. So it is natural to go to a situation where the lowest Landau", "level is occupied, meaning we make the magnetic field large enough, so that you have partial", "filling of the lowest Landau level. What we expected (and I was an active researcher at", "that time, so I remember the feeling precisely), we all expected that the system will form", "some kind of a lattice called Wigner crystal or perhaps a charge density wave. Why? Because", "you know the system would want to minimize the potential energy. When you go to the lowest", "Landau level, you basically have no kinetic energy left, right, you have only zero point", "energy, hbar omega_c divided by two, it&#39;s a constant. So if all the Landau levels are", "well-separated, that means in the high magnetic field limit, you just have potential energy.", "Well, we thought the system would minimize potential energy by forming a lattice just", "as ions form in a solid. Ions form a lattice, electrons form a gas, or a liquid. The reason", "is that ions are trying to minimize potential energy, and in a quantum system you minimize", "potential energy by staying away from each other, by forming a lattice. Well, that didn&#39;t", "happen! What happened, we found out, is the system formed an incompressible quantum liquid.", "Bob Laughlin wrote down a wave function for this liquid, and he showed that you have gaps", "at this fractional filling, when the fractional filling goes at 1/m, m being an odd denominator,", "so the original fraction 1/3, now we know it can happen at 1/5, and so on. But later", "on we found out that this fractional quantum Hall effect can take place generically at", "any fractional filling p/q, where q is an odd number, and p could be anything. Why?", "The reason is the system actually minimizes the energy by forming an incompressible quantum", "liquid, by forming gaps at these odd denominator fractions. Very strange system, where the", "minimization is associated with formation of an incompressible quantum liquid, and it&#39;s", "incompressible because there&#39;s an energy gap. Now we know from integer quantum Hall effect", "that having a gap is equivalent to having quantization of the Hall resistance or the", "Hall conductance. So that&#39;s exactly what happens in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Just", "like integer quantum Hall effect, the Hall conductance is quantized, but now not at integer", "filling, but at fractional filling because the system has formed this incompressible", "strongly correlated liquid because the original non-interacting system had a macroscopic degeneracy.", "All the electrons, in the thermodynamic limit infinite number of electrons, but even for", "real systems trillions of electrons, billions of electrons have exactly the same non-interacting", "energy. So the system has this macroscopic degeneracy, which relates to this very strange", "incompressible liquid. So if you look at this liquid, it&#39;s characterized by a gap, but it&#39;s", "characterized by something even more interesting, more bizarre. The excitations of this system,", "above this incompressible ground state are fractionally charged excitations. This follows", "very easily from the fact that the quantum Hall effect is quantized now by this fraction,", "it&#39;s a fractional multiple of this e^2/h, so that means whatever is carrying this Hall", "current must carry fractional charge. And this very intuitive heuristic argument can", "be actually made rigorous through topological argument that indeed the excitations are fractional,", "and these excitations what we would call Abelian excitations, they are anyons. They are not", "fermions, they are not bosons. When you take them around each other twice, instead of going", "back to where they started they pick up a phase. Well they may pick up a phase, I should", "say, and for fractional quantum Hall system they indeed pick up a phase. And so although", "fractional quantum Hall system looks like integer quantum Hall system, with the only", "difference that you have fractional Hall quantization rather than integer Hall quantization, there&#39;s", "a huge difference. The excitations for integer quantum Hall effect are integer charge excitations,", "here they are fractional charge excitations. But this similarity in the phenomenology actually", "is quite powerful, and it leads to the concept of the composite fermions, which are central", "to the understanding of fractional quantum Hall effect."]}
