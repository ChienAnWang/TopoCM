One is the Kitaev chain and the other is the quantum Hall state - integer", "quantum Hall state. So you may wonder: Are these two states completely unrelated to each", "other? And the answer is: They are closely related. To see that today let&#39;s start from", "the Kitaev chain and see how to construct a cousin of the quantum Hall, which is called", "the quantum anomalous Hall state. And that is also a prototype model, that helps you to", "understand all the newer stories of topological insulators. So let&#39;s start from this familiar", "Kitaev chain and I have drawn the chain in zigzag way, but it is the same one dimensional", "chain, you have seen before. And you know that depending whether the even-odd or odd-even", "bound is stronger there are two phases. There are this trivial phase and the topological", "phase, depending on this dimerization. Now let&#39;s consider the phase transition point", "between the two, which happens when you have the hopping from site one to two the same", "as the hopping from two to three. So that&#39;s the case where the hopping is completely uniform", "and the chain is at its critical point. So you know, that means that the chain is gapless", "and there can be electrons or Majorana fermions, either way. But in our model let&#39;s consider", "electrons. You have electrons moving in the system to left or right. So there is going", "to be left mover and right mover, depending on the wave function of electrons.", "Now give a wave packet, that has certain wave function, that only moves to the right, or", "you can give a wave function, that only moves to the left. So now what&#39;s the relation of", "this transition point to this two dimensional quantum Hall state, that we are interested", "in? So to see that let&#39;s consider a couple of coupled chains. Consider several of these", "Kitaev chains and introduce coupling between them. As we have discussed, there are right", "movers and left movers on each chain and then when you couple them depending on what coupling", "you turn on you can control which electrons couple to the other chain. So in particular", "you can design a very particular coupling, that only couples the left mover of this chain", "to the right mover of the next chain. And that doesn&#39;t couple the right mover of this", "chain to the next one. So if you introduce such a coupling, then the consequence is pretty", "clear. So this gives you that picture, which says that the left mover given by the blue", "arrows, the left mover will couple to the right mover of the second chain. Then that", "forms a bound state. So basically the electrons will get back scattered and there is no propagating", "electron anymore. So when you do this coupling one by one, in the end you find what you get", "is the state where the electron completely does not propagate in the bulk, because they", "got back scattered and the only thing that can propagate in the system is this left mover", "in the bottom edge and the right mover on the top edge.", "So this are the things left because they are not coupled by anything. So you see immediately", "the relation to quantum Hall state. In a quantum Hall state you have these electrons moving", "in Lorentz force like this and then", "consequently", "the electron is incompressible in the bulk. There is no conductivity, but at the boundary", "there is a chiral edge state. So very similar thing happened here for a very different reason.", "So you don&#39;t have an external magnetic field. You don&#39;t have flux. The electrons move around", "following the lattice to not see any flux on average there is a completely well defined", "translation symmetry on the lattice, but you have the same kind of any states. So this", "is actually topologically in the same phase as a quantum Hall state. This is what is called", "a quantum anomalous Hall state. So the key feature of the quantum anomalous Hall state", "is: you have this incompressible state in the bulk and you have this chiral edge state", "at the boundary. Now we have talked about this quantum anomalous", "Hall state. Let&#39;s add another twist to the system. We can ask: What if we not only turn", "around this coupling - this particular coupling that gave me the quantum anomalous Hall state", "and couples the blue to the red in the next chain. What if we introduce another term,", "that couples the blue and the red in the same chain? So what is that? That is actually something", "very familiar. That is something, coupling the left and right mover in a single chain,", "which means you go away from this critical point. So if we change not exactly at the", "critical point, but at something deviant from it, that means the coupling between the blue", "and red, the right and left mover of a single chain. So now you have a competition between", "the right and left mover in a single chain and the coupling two chains. So this competition", "is very similar to the one dimensional picture. If you view it in this direction, it looks", "like a Kitaev chain. For any fixed momentum it looks like a one", "dimensional chain, where this dimerization happened. So then it&#39;s very natural to generalize", "the one dimensional story and ask what happens if I tune these two couplings to be the same?", "You are going to kill this quantum anomalous Hall state, because each left mover is equally", "coupled to the red mover about and below it. So you don&#39;t know which one it prefers to", "hop to. The whole system actually goes across a phase transition. And this is very interesting,", "because this is actually a model that tells you the phase transition between quantum anomalous", "Hall state and trivial state - trivial insulator state. So if you calculate the Hall conductivity", "of this system, then you will get this quantized number, which is why in this case for the quantum", "anomalous Hall state and you will get zero in the other case, where each chain - the", "intra chain coupling is very strong. So the coupling between chains be ignored.", "And then when you cross over between the two then there is this phase transition point", "where the two dimensional system becomes massless and actually the dispersion looks like a Dirac-cone.", "So this is the very interesting point, that the massless Dirac-Fermion is deeply related", "to topological space and quantum Hall physics, because when you drive the quantum Hall state", "through phase transitions, where the Hall conductance changes, then you get this Dirac-Fermion."]}
