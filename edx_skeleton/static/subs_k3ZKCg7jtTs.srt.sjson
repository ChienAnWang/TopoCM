This red line here,", "which traverses the entire Brillioune zone is the new edge state. It crosses zero energy", "not only at k=0 in the edge Brillioune zone, but also at k=pi. The fact that the edge states", "or in higher dimensional cases the surface states cross pi or another time reversal invariant", "momentum in Brillouine zone is a generic feature of a system with a non trivial weak index.", "Now in this case if I add a staggered potential to the boundary or some kind of dimerization pattern,", "what will happen is when I fold a Brillouine zone I will now get a degeneracy,", "a crossing point between the edge branches which should have been folded. And now any perturbation", "will naturally lift the degeneracy and I can open a gap for the edge states. If I can open", "a gap at the edge states, that means I can now find a gapped real space interpolation", "between my putative topological weak phase and the vacuum outside. And because I have", "this gapped adiabatic interpolation it means we should think about these two phases as being", "equivalent and not distinguished by a non trivial topological invariant.", "This is exactly why translational symmetry is important - it means that if only the weak", "invariant is non zero, then breaking translational symmetry even just on the edge allows us to", "gap the system entirely and enables it to make it adiabatically connected to the vacuum.", "Ok, now that we have completed all the background we are now ready to discuss why weak topological", "systems are sensitive to translation defects called dislocations. Let&#39;s briefly review", "the idea of a dislocation. In this picture I have drawn a quasi one dimensional lattice of", "atoms and I have drawn two different edge dislocations indicated by these colored circles.", "Now an edge dislocation is generated if I jam in an extra partial line of atoms into", "this lattice. Here I put them in vertically, I could have also put them in horizontally", "and so the orientation could change. Now let&#39;s actually look at the characteristic property", "of a dislocation. First let&#39;s take a closed path in the reference lattice so basically", "far away from any dislocation. This closed path now I have is specified by taking three", "steps right, three up, three left and three down starting from a common point. And if", "I do this path it is closed, because I end up back where I started. If I take the exact", "same path by going three right, three up, three left, three down but enclosing a dislocation,", "I do not end up back where I started.", "And in fact I end up translated. And the amount of translation which differs from the initial", "position is called the Burgers vector of the dislocation. The Burgers vector is an intrinsic property", "of the dislocation. It does not change if I locally deform the core of the dislocation. And in", "fact it must be equal to some lattice vector. And this Burgers vector is what we would call", "the topological flux associated to each dislocation and it must be a lattice vector. An analogy", "between the dislocation and the Aharonov-Bohm effect for magnetic flux is very nice to see.", "So imagine here I have an isolated magnetic flux line and I have a charged electron, which", "I am going to subsequently take around this flux line. So now I have taken my electron,", "I have dragged it around this isolated magnetic flux, the wave function of the electron picks", "up a phase called the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The Aharonov-Bohm phase tells us that a charged", "particle will pick up a phase proportional to the charge times magnetic flux divided", "by hbar. If this was an isolated dislocation instead of a flux line, instead of picking", "up a U1 phase what we would pick up is a translation operator. The amount of translation is the Burgers vector", "times the momentum operator in this case, which is the generator of translations. Now the", "phase we pick up is actually a translation phase and is proportional to the momentum", "of the state and the Burgers vector of the dislocation.", "Now let&#39;s see why weak topological insulators have this nice interplay with dislocations.", "Imagine I stack up planes of some strong topological phase and I jam in an extra half plane of", "this topological state and this extra half plane represents an edge dislocation. The", "Burgers vector of this edge dislocation is in z-direction. The stacking vector of the", "planes is also in z-direction, so they are parallel. And you can see from this decoupled", "picture that this extra half plane will actually harbor a low energy bound state, the same", "type of low energy bound states that will exist on the full edge of a single plane.", "We can do the same thing in lower dimensions. So imagine now I have these lines of Kitaev", "p-wave wires, which are topological and I stack them up. If I now jam in an extra partial", "wire, on the end of it, it will contain a topological bound state. The same topological bound state", "which occurs on a natural boundary of this type of wires, namely a single Majorana mode.", "It turns out that the orientation of the stacking vector and the Burgers vector is important.", "So for example if I keep the Burgers vector the same, so basically I have this edge dislocation", "here, but I reorient the stacking vector, in this case we generate no topological bound state.", "There is an index that was predicted by Ran, Zhang and Vishwanath in 2009 in a", "Nature Physics paper, which tells us that the dot product between the weak topological", "index G and the Burgers vector of dislocation must be non zero in order to harbor topological", "bound states. And so the nice thing is, that even though we have drawn these weak topological", "phases as decoupled wires and decoupled planes, this topological bound state remains localized", "and robust even if we couple the wires and planes. This is sort of the generic topological", "feature of a weak topological phase.", "Well, that completes the basic introduction to weak topological phases and dislocation", "bound states. We&#39;ll come back in a little while to discuss open problems and exciting", "new directions in this field."]}
