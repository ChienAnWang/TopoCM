And the energy dispersion near these points", "is typically linear, very similar to the Weyl equation of particle physics.", "Hence we call these Weyl points, and the phase is called a Weyl semimetal. So Weyl points", "are sources and sinks of Berry flux, that is they are monopoles and anti-monopoles,", "and you may suspect there is something topological about them.", "In order to diagnose their topology, we know what to do: we need to look at the surface", "states. Before we do that, there&#39;s a note of caution when you look at surface states", "of gapless systems.", "The surface states are only well defined at energies and crystal momenta where there are", "no bulk states. Otherwise they can leak into the bulk.", "So if you set the energy exactly to the energy of the Weyl points, you can define surface", "states over the entire surface Brillouin zone except at the two points where the bulk Weyl", "points project onto the surface.

Fermi surfaces in two dimensions are expected to be closed - closed", "curves. But here we have an open curve. And the ends of the curve are exactly at the singular", "points where surface states can leak into the bulk.", "Okay. So, as a sanity check we may wonder how these surface states can arise if we start", "with a thin slab of the material.
