So I&#39;d like to tell you about a very simple", "toy-model that I invented many years ago when I was at the University of California, San", "Diego, in order to demonstrate that the quantum Hall effect could occur without needing strong", "magnetic field or Landau levels, and instead could just occur when you have a standard", "Bloch band structure, with broken time-reversal invariance but no magnetic flux through the", "system. Well, this is what is now called the Chern", "insulator, or the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and it may be considered the precursor to", "today&#39;s time-reversal invariant topological insulators, which were discovered as a generalization", "to the toy-model that I am going to present you today.", "So, the starting point of the model is a model point for graphene with nearest and next-nearest", "neighbour hopping on a honeycomb structure, which has two sites in the unit cell, which", "I am going to call the A sites and the B sites. You can see it on the screen behind me.", "So, as you probably know graphene is a semi-metal where the conduction and valence bands touch", "at two distinct Dirac points, which are these points in the corner of the Brillouin zone,", "number one and number two, or number one and number two.", "And... and the states at the Fermi level are then described by a 2D version of a massless", "Dirac model, a field theory. So, I am going to take the electrons to be", "spinless, which really means that they are fully spin-polarized.", "Now the gapless Dirac points are topologically protected, but they are only protected if", "both spatial inversion and time-reversal invariance are present.", "So the inversion symmetry exchanges the A and the B points, so it has these inversion", "points up here and right here, at the center and the sides of the unit cell.", "And it&#39;s broken if the A and the B sites are occupied by different atoms, as in the alpha-", "gapped semiconductor boron nitride. So what I wanted to do is to break time-reversal", "symmetry without breaking any of the spatial symmetries of the model.", "So the way to do this is to introduce second, complex second neighbor hopping.", "Real second neighbor hopping is in principle always present, and it in fact destroys an", "unphysical particle-hole symmetry of the model which.. where you only keep first neighbor", "hopping present. This is OK because particle-hole symmetry", "is not a symmetry of real graphene. However to break the time-reversal symmetry", "I made the second neighbor hopping complex. So second neighbor hoppings are either clockwise", "or anti-clockwise relative to the six-fold rotation axis of the center of the unit cell.", "So I give to all the clockwise second neighbor hopping amplitudes... an amplitude equal to", "t, a complex number, and the anti-clockwise are its complex conjugate t star.", "So the fact that forward and backward scattering hopping in the direction of this arrow are", "not equivalent to each other is the symptom of time-reversal breaking.", "So, when a gap opens the Dirac points are now modeled by a massive Dirac equation, and", "a key point is that the mass term in the Dirac equation, the sigma z term, is chiral, which", "means that it has a handedness. It depends on the relative handedness of x", "+ iy. So, when (only) inversion symmetry is broken", "the two Dirac points are still related by time-reversal symmetry, which reverses the", "handedness.

So these edge states arise on this edge, because", "there is an excess number of B sites, one for every three edge unit cells, relative", "to the A sites, and the particle-hole symmetry in the bulk requires equal numbers of B sites", "and A sites. So any local excess of one type of site over", "the other over at the edge appears as zero modes.", "So when the gap opens, the edge state has to remain attached to the conduction band", "or the valence band at each of the two projections of the Dirac points.", "So there are four choices: if both connections are to the same band, as in these two examples", "on the left, both connected to the conduction band or both connected to the valence band,", "this is the case where the gap was open by the breaking of inversion symmetry. Nothing", "special. But if the time-reversal symmetry was the", "one that was broken, the edge mode becomes a conduit connecting the conduction and valence", "bands, because one end is attached to the projection of the Dirac point in the upper", "band and the other end is connected to the projection of the Dirac point in the lower", "band. So this becomes a conduit that allows... allows", "spectral flow of states between the conduction and valence band.", "This is a fundamental property that&#39;s required by the chiral anomaly of the quantum Hall", "effect. If the magnetic flux through the bulk region", "here is increased by one Dirac flux quantum h/e, one state will be transferred either", "from the conduction band to the valence band or from the valence band to the conduction", "band, depending on the sign of this quantum Hall effect.", "So to make this transfer of states from conduction to valence band possible, a chiral edge state", "must exist and must propagate in one direction, so it gives you this, this conduit that allows", "the states to flow between the bands. So in the bulk this anomaly is connected with", "a net non-zero Chern number of the occupied bulk bands.", "The Chern number is given by... is an integer which is given by an integral of the Bloch", "state Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone. And it determines two fundamental chiral anomalies,", "chiral quantum anomalies of the problem, which... one of which is a failure of the charge conservation", "law of the edge states, taken by itself without reference to the bulk - the electric charge", "conservation law. And the other one is a failure of the conservation", "of momentum parallel to the edge, if you don&#39;t take into account the bulk.", "So these are the quantum anomalies which are fundamental and give you a topological index,", "and in the case of this non-interacting fermion system they&#39;re both equal to the Chern number", "of the occupied bands."]}
