My name is Fabian Hassler. I am working at the RWTH University in Aachen.

Such operations are called deformations", "of the Hamiltonian. The problem here is that you have to test for all conceivable ways", "how you could possibly deform a Hamiltonian into the other one. This is a hard to impossible", "task to do in practice. So here is where the notion of topological invariants come into", "the game. You have seen that two Hamiltonians have the same topological invariants if they", "are in the same class.", "Now, instead of testing for all possible ways to transform a Hamiltonian into another one, it", "seems to be much simpler to test if the topological invariants are the same. However, for that", "we need to have a simple way to determine the topological invariant given a specific", "Hamiltonian, which is the task of todays lecture.", "You might wonder why you should care about topological invariants in the first place.", "In order to understand the importance of the topological invariants you should remember", "the basic fact originating from the bulk-boundary correspondence that bringing two materials", "with distinct topological indices together, a well-defined number of surface states are", "formed at the interface.
