You&#39;ve already seen how for a system of non-interacting", "electrons, in the absence of impurities, in a strong magnetic field, you can get a quantized", "Hall effect, with exact quantization of the Hall conductance.", "What the edge states help us to do is to see, and understand in a way somewhat complementary", "to Laughlin&#39;s argument, why the quantization remains exact even in the presence of impurities", "and electron-electron interactions. In order to see this, let me bring your attention", "to this figure that I have posted over here. This is supposed to represent a two-dimensional", "electron gas in an annular Corbino geometry. This two-dimensional electron gas is bounded", "by these two edges. I divided the ring into two parts.", "The white region is supposed to be a region where there are no impurities, and the electron-electron", "interaction is turned off. So this is an ideal system and we already", "know what will happen if the Fermi level is in between two Landau levels.", "There are no states in the bulk at the Fermi level.", "The system is in a quantized Hall state, but there will be of course states at the Fermi", "level along the edges. These will be the chiral edge states which", "propagate in the direction of the arrows. Two opposite directions in the opposite edges.", "Now in this region here I am assuming that we have some impurities, and perhaps we&#39;ll", "turn on some electron-electron interactions. And we know that if we introduce impurities,", "that can easily produce states at the Fermi level.", "But these states will be tied to the impurities, so if the number of the impurities is not", "too large, these states will be localized about the individual impurities with a localization", "length of the order of the magnetic length. And if the distance between the inner and", "outer edges of the sample is very large compared to this localization length, it is very difficult", "or impossible for an electron at low temperatures (zero temperature) and low voltages to get", "across from one edge to the other. This region is basically insulating.", "And that is an important factor. The other factor is that there are only localized", "states at the Fermi level in the bulk, but there still have to be extended states around", "the edges in order to carry current. Okay, so now we can imagine what happens if", "we add a bunch of electrons in this inner edge here, say at this point here - let&#39;s", "ask what happens. Of course these electrons will propagate in", "the direction of the arrow around the edge, until they get to this shaded area, where", "they have to still continue because the current has to be conserved, and they will keep going", "around and around. But they will stay on this edge because they", "can&#39;t go from the inner edge to the outer edge.", "So eventually they will reach some kind of thermal equilibrium state, where we can define", "a chemical potential, or more precisely an electrochemical potential, which has to be", "constant all the way around this edge, and can be different from the electrochemical", "potential defined on the other edge. If we connect a voltmeter between the inside", "edge and outside edge, an ideal voltmeter, we&#39;ll exactly measure this difference in electrochemical", "potentials. If it draws no current, then this can continue", "forever. If it draws a small amount of current, than", "we can add a battery to maintain that current, and keep these two edges at different voltages,", "independent of time. Now we can ask what happens to the current.", "We know that in this region, which is an ideal quantized Hall conductor, there will be a", "current, and that current, flowing in say this direction, which will be equal to the", "voltage times the quantized Hall conductance. What happens when the current gets to this", "edge - well, this part of the sample. If we are in equilibrium and we are in a steady", "state, we know that charge has to be conserved, so therefore current cannot have any divergence.", "The current has to be the same everywhere around this loop.", "But we also know that the voltage, we reached equilibrium so the voltage is constant on", "this edge and this edge. The voltage difference between these two points", "is the same as the voltage difference between these two points.", "And the current is the same, so the current is still related to the voltage difference", "by precisely the same ratio, namely the quantized Hall conductance, in the region where we have", "impurities as in the region where we don&#39;t have impurities.", "Now there&#39;s something else I would like to add though, about the role of electron-electron", "interactions, which is sometimes ignored. In this region where we have electron-electron", "interactions, it is no longer true that the current is only carried by the edge states.", "If you have electron-electron interactions, and we have a different charge density on", "the two edges, there will in general be an electric field pointing from the inner edge", "to the outer edge. And that electric field can drive a Hall current", "in the bulk, in the system, even though the states at the Fermi surface are completely", "localized. We know that there have to be states below", "the Fermi surface, below the Fermi energy, in the middle of a Landau level, which are", "delocalized, and can extend around the sample. It&#39;s perfectly allowed for the electric field", "to produce a current going around these edge stat.. sorry, flowing around these states", "below the Fermi surface. We cannot have a current flowing parallel", "to electric field for the states below the Fermi surface, because that would violate", "essentially charge conservation, and... charge and energy conservation.", "But we can have... we can&#39;t have current flowing parallel to the electric field, we can have", "current flowing perpendicular to the electric field.", "And that&#39;s what happens. So in the case where there are electron electron", "interactions the current is not confined to the edges, but the total current flowing around", "here, and in this region, has to be conserved. It has to be the same, so we still have a", "quantized Hall conductance. One other thing I&#39;d like to just mention,", "is that this argument that I&#39;ve given for the integer quantum Hall effect in terms of", "edge states can actually be very easily adapted to the situation we have a fractional quantized", "Hall effect. So if there is a region here where there are", "electron-electron interactions but there are no impurities, and I have an ideal system", "with a fractional quantum Hall effect, say at quantized Hall conductance one third, and", "if this region has a certain amount of disorder but I don&#39;t introduce any states at the Fermi", "surface which can cross from one edge to the other, then it&#39;s still true that current must", "be conserved and I will have a Hall current in this region which is exactly given b the", "same quantized Hall, fractional quantized Hall, conductance, as we have in this region."]}
