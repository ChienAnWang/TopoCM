We saw that with the choice of proper parameters,", "this model supports Majorana fermions at the end of the chain. This model is very special:", "it&#39;s in 1D, it&#39;s a one dimensional model. There&#39;s only one type of particles, there&#39;s", "no spin flavor, and they are pairing up somehow to form a superconductor. So in some sense", "this model is a half of the conventional superconductor. For me it is very aspiring to think how about", "the possibility to build this type of a toy model, using ingredients that exist in the", "laboratory, using real systems. This is generally a very interesting approach to study problems", "in modern physics: there&#39;s a toy model, and you have to think deeply how to create it", "in the laboratory, and on the way learn many things. So initially it seems hopeless: we", "know that the one-dimensional wires exist in nature, they can in principle be fabricated", "in the laboratory, but superconductivity is very weak in 1D, and in any case pairing is", "between spin up and spin down electrons. So how can we create pairing between spin up", "electrons? But thinking about it a bit more, there is a possibility to create an effective", "model, effectively this Kitaev chain model. This can be done especially if we don&#39;t take", "all the ingredients from the same material, but rather take two or more different materials,", "combine the properties together to form the conditions needed for the creation of Kitaev", "model.

Then through the Andreev", "reflection, through pair tunneling of electrons with opposite spins to the superconductor,", "superconducting gap is induced in the wire. So the wire becomes superconducting. Now we", "want to get rid of one of the species, of the spin flavors. This can be done by applying", "a very strong magnetic field. Then we will have only spin up electrons in the nanowire.", "However we pay a price: of course if we only have spin up electrons in the wire, we cannot", "induce superconducting gap in the wire. We need spin up and spin down to hop from the", "wire to the superconductor, to get there a pair of these guys. But there&#39;s only spin", "up in the wire. So the gap, the induced superconducting gap in the wire disappears when we apply strong", "magnetic field. So we need something more, something in addition. We need something that", "will rotate the spin in the wire. Now this rotation can be done in the wire or in the", "transition between the wire to the superconductor, or in the superconductor itself. And this", "something is spin-orbit coupling. So if we have spin-orbit coupling, that coupling that", "rotates the spin of the electrons as they move in a very strong electric field, this", "will allow to have only one flavor, one species of particles in the wire, let&#39;s say spin up.", "They rotate due to the spin-orbit coupling, and then they can hop to the superconductor.", "So we have one flavor in the wire, but the spin is not a good quantum number anymore.", "And indeed, so far all the experiments that observe signatures of Majorana fermions were", "being of one-dimensional systems in proximity to a superconductor (so we need superconductivity)", "and they were heavy materials, so they had spin-orbit coupling, and we add also the action", "of magnetic field.
