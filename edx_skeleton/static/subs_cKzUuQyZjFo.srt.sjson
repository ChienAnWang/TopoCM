They can also have interesting topological properties.", "So in this case we have topological superconductors.", "Again, the essential role of particle-hole symmetry in the BdG Hamiltonians was emphasized.", "Also, topological states of matter can exist in various spatial dimensions. Topological", "insulators can exist in both two and three dimensions, and the Kitaev chain, which is", "defined on the one-dimensional lattice, can realize one-dimensional topological superconducting", "phase.", "Given all these known examples, one may start to ask a question like: what if we have both", "time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries?
