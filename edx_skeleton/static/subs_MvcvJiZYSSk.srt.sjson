First question is:", "can these materials be realized in Nature, so can we actually realize a weak topological phase", "in a real material system. We might be skeptical because these systems are protected by", "translation symmetry", "and any real material will not be pristine. It will have defects, and things like that which in", "principle break the translation symmetry.", "But it turns out that these weak topological insulators ", "are at least slightly robust from this type of disorder,", "because they actually have been found in Nature. So there have been several material proposals", "for systems with nontrivial", "weak indices, and actually just a few months ago there was a paper", "which did measurements on a proposed weak topological insulator", "in a bismuth compound. And they measured the properties of step edges", "on the surface of the material. Now a step edge occurs when an edge dislocation", "floats to the surface of the material and forms an extra bump ", "or step on the surface. The boundary of this step, where the step goes from up to  down,", "can now harbor these types of topological bound states. And there&#39;s at least initial evidence that these", "step edges actually do harbor these bound states ,which is exciting", "for this field. Along with this, the weak topological insulator are only the first step", "in understanding so-called topological  crystalline phases of matter, ", "which are phases of matter which are topological and protected by spatial symmetries.", "So translational symmetry is one type of spatial symmetry", "we can also have rotational symmetries or reflection and mirror symmetries ", "or any other type of point group or space group symmetries.", "So later in this course we will discuss topological crystalline insulators, so we will hold off", "most of such discussion till then. But let&#39;s briefly talk about the case of", "rotation symmetric systems. There are defects for rotation symmetry called ", "disclinations.", "And what I&#39;m showing you on this slide is a picture of the square lattice with the", "minus ninety degree disclination. Essentially if I take a loop", "around this disclination, instead of being translated,", "you can see I end up back where I started by taking the loop, I am instead rotated.", "It&#39;s a rotation defect. For the square lattice, since there are two different", "rotation centers we can have different types of defects", "with the same angular deficit. So for example the top two defects here", "have the same minus ninety degree rotation angle once I traverse the path", "around it", "but they differ in the core. In the left disclination I have a trivalent vertex in the ", "core, and for the right disclination I have a triangular plaquette.", "The same can be said for plus ninety  degrees. In these cases on the left side I have a", "five valent vertex in the core, and in this case i have a ", "pentagon in the core. So we have two different types of disclinations ", "for each angular deficit either plus ninety or minus ninety ", "for this case. We might ask, can these disclinations harbor ", "topological bound states. The first indication this is true is from the following example.", "Basically a dislocation itself is a disclination dipole.", "What I have drawn here is a slide showing the edge dislocation ", "and I&#39;m highlighting through these green lines the disclination dipole.", "I have a trivalent vertex next to a pentagon", "in this is a plus 90 and a minus 90 degrees disclination", "bound to each other. If this dislocation", "sits in a weak topological phase which harbors a bound state, and we split", "the disclination apart into its two constituent pieces,", "we might ask how does the topological bound state decide where to go", "does it still exists, does it split, does it fractionalize,", "does it follow one or the other? I will leave this as a question", "for an excited listener, but the idea is that", "the actual bound states will follow one of the two different disclination in this case.", "So far we&#39;ve only been considering non interacting", "or maybe weakly interacting weak topological phases.", "There are some examples of weak topological phases that can only exist in the", "presence", "of strong interactions, some topological invariants that are only nontrivial when you have", "strong interactions.", "We won&#39;t consider these further here, but this possibility is an exciting new direction.", "Additionally, even for weakly interacting systems ", "there could be an interesting interplay between spontaneous", "spatial ordering and the spatial  protection of the weak topological", "phase. Some systems which are weak topological phases may want to break", "the spatial symmetry spontaneously", "and due to that there may be interesting interplay between dynamics of  the order", "parameter", "and the former topology in the spatially  protected phase.", "Overall this field is at an exciting stage.", "There&#39;s some initial experiments which are optimistic and there are many ", "new theoretical and experimental developments to come."]}
