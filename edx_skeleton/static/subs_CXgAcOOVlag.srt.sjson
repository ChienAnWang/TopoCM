So in summary what we see is that when", "you have a lower dimensional topological state. When you drive it to a critical point then", "you get a massless state. So this is how we understand massless states, as critical points", "between massive states. And once you have these massless states, there are two ways", "to couple them and get higher dimensional topological states. And another important", "information we learned from this class is that the quantum anomalous Hall state itself", "- that means that the quantum Hall state/the quantum Hall conductance can be realized in", "lattice models with full lattice translation symmetry, without any external magnetic field.", "So this is one example of the quantum anomalous Hall model and there are other models, for", "example the Haldane model, which you will learn later in this course. The common feature", "of these models is that you don&#39;t have Landau levels - electrons are moving around in the", "system, but there is a gap. The bulk is an insulator and there are chiral edge states", "on the boundary. The chiral edge states can not exist by itself in one dimension. As you", "see in the one dimensional chain model there is always left and right mover. This is a", "very general principle, that it&#39;s not possible to have only left mover in the system. So", "the only way to realize only left mover is on the boundary of a higher dimensional state.", "And this is exactly - this is a very general relation between forbidden states in a lower", "dimension and non-trivial topological states in higher dimensions. You will see later similar", "examples in other states, such as quantum spin Hall states. So we also discussed that", "there is this critical point between quantum Hall state and trivial state. The same kind", "of critical point exists in the ordinary quantum Hall state, but there it&#39;s less transparent", "what happened at the critical point. In this topological quantum anomalous Hall model you", "can see clearly that when I tune the system to a critical point by making a competition", "between inter chain coupling and intra chain coupling, then the critical point itself is", "a massless Dirac fermion in two dimensions. So then let the Dirac fermion actually describe", "a lot of critical behaviors in the quantum Hall system and also it allows you to go on", "with this construction and couple these critical states together and form a higher dimensional", "topological state. So in the end I just want to emphasize this model, which we call lattice", "Dirac model. So we have shown these by pictures and if you write down Hamiltonians, you start", "by Kitaev chains and couple them, then you will get a model in the momentum space, because", "it is translational invariant. You get a two dimensional Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian", "has two bands - there are these two bands here - the Hamiltonian has two bands and it", "- the Hamiltonian looks like this, where you write using Pauli matrices and you have this", "sine(k) terms, which are like lattice version of these linear k terms - the linear in partial", "derivatives in the Dirac model and you have these cos(k) terms, which is a regularized", "mass. So and after that in this model - because Dirac models can be used as prototype models", "for all the free fermion topological states, it plays a particularly important role. Although", "we are not saying that all the topological states have to be described by Dirac model", "- you have many other models/many other realistic systems described by the system, but the Dirac", "model is particularly nice. It is the same form of model, where you obtain by lattice", "version of the famous Dirac equation, then in any dimensions you can get a theoretical", "description of all the different topological states."]}
