This parameter", "could be for example the confining potential or a magnetic flux.", "But let&#39;s think about a concrete example. We&#39;d like to think about a 1D system with", "a periodic confining potential, and we&#39;d like to use the offset position of this confining", "potential as the parameter that we wish to vary. Now the levels in each of these local", "minima are quantized, we would like to adjust the chemical potential such that in each local", "minimum a certain fixed number of these levels that is filled within", "each of these local minima. As we periodically start to move our confining potential, if", "we do it slowly enough, then the particles would begin to slide. After a full pumping", "period, when the confining potential has shifted exactly by one period, then we have moved", "a quantized number of particles have moved from one end of the sample to the other end", "of the sample. This number, of course, depends on the number of particles that were trapped", "in each of these local minima. This system is called a Thouless pump.", "Now in terms of topology, a pumping period corresponds to a 1D cycle in parameter space.", "There is an accumulated phase that is associated with this path. It has a geometrical part,", "a dynamical part, and a topological part. The topological part of the phase is discrete.", "It has to do with the ability to shrink deform this path into a single point. Now", "since the accumulated phase along a single point is zero, then if we can do this, if", "we can shrink our original path to a single point, we say that any pumping", "properties of the system are not topologically protected. Conversely, if for some reason", "this cannot be done, then we say that the pumping properties", "of this system are topologically protected and distinct from a", "trivial pump. So if we want to now construct a physical", "pump, we would like to open our system and to connect it to some leads or probes. A non", "trivial pumping cycle would correspond to a transfer of charge or spin", "to or from the probes. This requires the a zero energy state to appear", "some time along the cycle, in order to allow the charge or spin to relax into the leads.", "But our family of Hamiltonians is gapped for every value of this continuous", "parameter. So the only place, where this zero energy state could", "appear is at the very end of our insulator. This shows the intimate relation between the", "pumping properties and the appearance of edge states.", "Let&#39;s go back to our pump. As we vary the offset potential by exactly one period, there", "would appear a vacant minimum at the very end of the system. These vacant minimum is", "in fact our edge state, and it allows to particles from the leads to jump on to our system. So", "how do we calculate the topological invariant? Well, in fact we have a simple way of calculating", "the invariant which also makes use of the bulk edge correspondence that you studied,", "a little bit like what you did in the Majorana wire. So as we argued,", "the pumping is related to the appearance of edge states along the pumping cycle. If we", "now would like to perform a scattering experiment by sending electrons from the leads to scatter", "off our sample, then we expect that the phase shift of these scattered electrons would be", "sensitive to the appearance of edge states at the very", "end. So in fact every time an edge state crosses", "the fermi level, the phase of the scattered particles gets shifted", "by \u03c0. And every time a non trivial pumping cycle is completed, the phase of", "the scattered particles winds by an integer multiple of 2\u03c0 . So there&#39;s a mapping between", "a circle in parameter space corresponding to our pumping cycle and a circle that the", "phase of the reflection matrix performs along this path. And this mapping actually is associated", "with a topological index, which essentially counts how many times the phase of the reflection", "matrix winds around zero during a single pumping cycle. Because edge states, as we said, are", "associated with a 2\u03c0 phase shift, then this also counts the number of edge states that", "appear within a single cycle. So why is this winding protected? why cant we just deform", "our pumping cycle back to a point? Well, to do that, we would need to take the amplitude", "and continuously shrink it down to zero. However, there is charge conservation. If the scattered", "particles are not reflected, they must be transmitted. But if they are transmissed,", "the system is no longer insulating, and we would like to think about a system that is", "insulating at all moments. Namely, if we want a system that remains", "insulating throughout the entire cycle, the reflection amplitude must stay 1 throughout", "the cycle, and that means that any winding of the", "phase is topologically protected. So we can use this winding invariant to characterize", "our pumps. It is also a very useful method to characterizing the Hamiltonians", "because it&#39;s much easier to calculate this winding invariant than it is to calculate", "the bulk invariant because essentially all you need", "to know is what happens at the very end of your sample.", "Let&#39;s see a bit more details now."]}
