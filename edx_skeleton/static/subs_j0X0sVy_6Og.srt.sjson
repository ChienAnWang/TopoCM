The first one we studied", "today was this chain, with its intruguing properties.", "In particular, the moving kinks, and the fact that at the position of the kink, which is", "a domain wall in the orientation of these rotors, there is a zero energy mode that is", "localized there because the gap closes at that position and enables the kink to move", "down this chain.", "An interesting feature is that the position where the zero mode is located is over-constrained", "compared to the two ends of the chain, which are rigid.", "And this over-constrained region is actually softer, because it can move.", "Similar behavior can be observed also in two-dimensional examples.", "For example, we looked at this twisted kagome lattice, which has dislocations, which are", "topological defects capable of harboring soft modes, very much like the kinks, here.", "Notice that everywhere far from the dislocation, the structure is rigid. However, this dislocation", "supports a zero energy mode. The other dislocation, which cannot move, supports a state of self-stress.", "States of self-stress are passive players when it comes to motion, but they are still", "very useful to control how materials respond to compression, and in particular how materials", "fail.", "We demonstrated that by studying this three-dimensional structure, which is obtained by stacking kagome", "lattices like this one which have an additional property: they have domain walls along which", "you can localize states of self-stress.", "When you compress such a structure, it will preferentially fail, or buckle, along the", "line where the states of self-stress are localized.", "This allows us to control the way this material fails.", "What do all these structures have in common. They are examples of topological mechanical", "meta-materials.", "A mechanical meta-material is a macroscopic structure with very unusual properties.
