First of all, when we discussed periodically driven systems, what", "we were referring to are systems whose evolution is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian,", "where the time dependence is periodic, meaning that it repeats itself any integer multiple", "of some driving period, which I have called capital T here for example.", "Now, in our previous studies of topological insulators the focus was always on the eigenstates", "of the Hamiltonian - in particular the many-body ground state.", "When we have a system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, there isn&#39;t a ground state anymore.", "In fact, there aren&#39;t really any useful eigenstates to speak of.", "I could imagine diagonalizing this Hamiltonian at any instant of time t, but generally speaking", "those eigenstates don&#39;t tell me very much about the evolution of the system.", "So, where do we go? Well, for this specific case of periodic driving, there is a very", "useful operator called the Floquet operator, which is the time-evolution operator that", "propagates the system forward in time through one complete driving period, capital T.", "Why is this thing useful? Well, if I imagine some type of stroboscopic, or discrete, time-evolution,", "where I only look at the state of the system say at time zero, capital T, two times capital", "T, and so forth, then I apply the same unitary operator over and over again to move the system", "forward through these discrete time steps.", "In that way, the Floquet operator plays a very analogous role to the Hamiltonian of", "a non-driven system. Meaning that if I would expand the evolution in the basis of eigenstates", "of this U of capital T, that would be very simple:", "I would just wind some trivial phase factors on each of the components in the eigenstates.", "So, this picture gives us a nice basis for trying to import some of the ideas of topological", "classification from non-driven systems into the context of periodically-driven systems.", "However there are some very important differences. In particular, if I think about a band structure,", "then in a non-driven system I can imagine that this band structure lives on some kind", "of cylinder. What do I mean?", "Well, I have the crystal momentum which parametrizes some circle if it&#39;s one dimensional, and some", "torus if it&#39;s higher dimensional.

Therefore", "this is some kind of cylinder here.", "In the case of periodically driven system, now I still have this periodic crystal momentum", "variable, but in addition the energy-like variable, this quasi-energy, is itself periodic.", "So the spectrum lives on a torus instead of a cylinder. Because of this different topology", "of the surface that the spectrum lives on, the topological classification of these systems", "is different as well.", "Now, this has many important consequences and gives rise to phenomena which can arise", "in periodically driven systems, but cannot arise in non-driven systems.", "For example, in a two-dimensional system where the Chern numbers of all bands are zero, if", "this was a non-driven system we would expect it to have no chiral edge modes.", "But in fact in the periodically driven case it turns out there can be chiral edge modes.", "And more careful consideration of this idea leads us to understand that in fact, in the", "end, thus Floquet operator, although it was very useful for building up the basis for", "topological classification, it doesn&#39;t hold all of the information we need to understand", "the topological features of a driven system.", "Instead, it&#39;s crucial to look at all the information contained in the evolution operator U of t,", "this time-ordered exponential, for all times between zero all the way up to the driving", "period, capital T.", "So - you know - up to this point we have a pretty good understanding now of the topological", "features of the single particle states of a driven system on a lattice.", "Now, if the system is not being driven, we know that by cooling it down electrons will", "tend to go and fill up the lowest energy states.
