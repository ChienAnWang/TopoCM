One aspect of fractional quantum Hall effect,", "which is very interesting, and which you already learned about, is that phenomenologically", "it looks just like integer quantum Hall effect, except that the effect happens at fractional", "filling rather than integer filling. This of course gives rise to the picture of composite", "fermions, where instead of talking about the original bare electrons you now talk about", "electrons which are coupled to an integer number, even number of fluxes to be specific,", "which now behave as if, these composite fermions, named by Jainendra Jain, as if they are undergoing", "integer quantum Hall effect in this remaining field. So you, let&#39;s say, for one third, you&#39;d", "say take two of those fluxes, attach them to you electrons, so they become new kind", "of object, composite fermions, but one flux is still left over, so that gives rise to", "the integer quantum Hall effect of these fractional objects. They are no longer fractional composite", "fermions, and this picture has been extremely powerful, and has explained basically all", "the known odd denominator fractions that exist in nature. You can write down wave functions,", "and these wave functions seem to be very very good. The way you know they are very very", "good is that you can do numerical work, or you can look at experiments, and you find", "that the fractions that show up precisely are the ones you get from this composite fermion", "prescription, and this is still a very much an ongoing subject. But the main thing I want", "to talk about in this concluding speech, or lecture, whatever it is, is the exception", "to this odd denominator rule for fractional quantum Hall effect. You know that the fractional", "quantum Hall effect originally was seen at fraction 1/3, and that it was seen in many", "many fractions of the nature of p/q, where q is always an odd number. And this odd number", "seems to be an unavoidable consequence of Pauli principle. That electrons obey Pauli", "principle, so the wave function must have this form z_i minus z_j to the power m, where", "m is odd, z being the spatial coordinate of the electrons. So it seems that you cannot", "avoid it because when z_i is equal to z_j you must get a zero. But amazingly in 1987,", "almost thirty years ago, an even denominator fraction specifically the fraction five over", "2, two and a half was seen. So what does it mean? I should add that no such fraction is", "seen at nu equal to half, only at nu equal to 5/2 and 7/2. This turns out to be an effect", "which is as interesting as fractional quantum Hall effect itself. It&#39;s called &#39;even denominator", "fractional quantum Hall effect&#39;, and these objects are thought to be a strongly correlated", "system, which has a spinless p-wave superconductivity. You can write down the wave function very", "similar to Lauglin wave function, and now Greg Moore and Nick Read wrote this wave function", "down. And this wave function has the form that the polynomial part has z_i minus z_j", "to the power 2, corresponding to 5/2, that two. And of course they cannot be then electrons,", "because they are essentially the wave function for p-wave spinless superconductor. And in", "fact the wave function that Moore and Read wrote down is exactly the same as a BCS wave", "function for spinless p-wave superconductivity in real space. So what is going on? What is", "going on conceptually is very simple, that because of interaction electrons pair, and", "those pairs, that condense, the pairs you can think of them as bosons, so the even denominator", "is allowed. It turns out that this particular ground state is fascinating. This particular", "ground state also has fractional excitations. Actually fractional excitations of different", "types. Neutral excitations, various kinds of charged excitations, some carrying charge", "e/4, some carrying charge E/2. In particular this e/4 charge excitations, are non-Abelian", "anyons. They are not ordinary fermions or bosons at all. They are non-Abelian anyons,", "which obey this braiding statistics. In two dimensions if you take them around each other,", "there&#39;s a quantum degeneracy in the ground state, and it could go from one of these degenerate", "ground states to the other one. And this property that when you take them around each other,", "they could basically make a unitary transformation with this degenerate subspace, allows you", "to do topological quantum computation using these objects. Why is it topological quantum", "computation? Because this property is topologically protected. Remember, fractional quantum Hall", "is a topological phenomenon. So this property that they are non-Abelian anyons is topologically", "protected by the gap. Because you&#39;d not see this 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect, except", "for the existence of the gap. So this is a highly exciting subject in which enormous", "amount of work is going on right now to see if a topological quantum computer can be built", "using these fractionally charged non-Abelian anyonic objects. So with that statement I&#39;ll", "conclude my lecture."]}
