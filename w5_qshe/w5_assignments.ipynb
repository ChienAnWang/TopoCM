    "The first known implementation of quantum spin Hall effect is the Kane-Mele model, introduced in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411737). It is a doubled copy of the Haldane model (get that one from the previous week's notebooks), with spin up and spin down having next-nearest neighbor hoppings complex conjugate of each other due to spin-orbit coupling.\n",
